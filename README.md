# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques, specifically **Logistic Regression**. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various patient attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. By using these features, the model predicts whether the patient is likely to have heart disease.

## Project Overview

This machine learning project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict heart disease in patients based on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. The project covers the following aspects:

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning (if applicable)

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the model
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating the logistic regression model
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization (optional)

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset**, which is publicly available and contains information about patients, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Chest pain type
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- History of heart disease (target variable)

You can find the dataset here: [framingham Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset/data).

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values.
- Convert categorical features into numerical form (using one-hot encoding or label encoding).
- Normalize/scale features if necessary.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Installation
